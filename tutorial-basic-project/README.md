# Tutorial basic project

This is an (almost) bare-bones example that displays a simple "hello world" message on the terminal.
Compared to the official hello_world example, this project removes all elements that are not strictly necessary.

This project can serve as a foundational starting point for step-by-step tutorials.

> [!WARNING] 
> To start the example, remember to set the target and select the flash port!
